## MDX Support

MDX is a powerful tool that allows you to combine Markdown and JSX in a single file.
This enables you to create interactive and engaging documentation that includes code 
snippets, components, and more. With MDX, you can easily embed React components, making 
your documentation more dynamic and informative.

It's easy to get started with MDX in Minimal Docs. Simply create a new `.mdx` file in the
`/pages/docs` directory, and you're ready to go. You can use Markdown syntax for text
formatting and JSX for more complex components and interactivity.

## Mermaid Support

Mermaid is a simple markdown-like language for generating diagrams and flowcharts.
It allows you to create visual representations of complex concepts, making them easier 
to understand and digest.

Minimal Docs includes built-in support for Mermaid, so you can easily add diagrams and
flowcharts to your documentation. Simply use the Mermaid syntax in your MDX files, and
the diagrams will be rendered automatically.

## Charts

Charts are a powerful way to visualize data and make complex information more accessible.
Minimal Docs provide support for various chart types, including line, bar, and pie charts.

Minimal Docs uses [@mantine/charts](https://mantine.dev/charts/getting-started/) to create
beautiful and interactive charts. You can easily customize the appearance and behavior of
the charts to fit your specific needs.

For more information on how to use charts in Minimal Docs, check out the [Charts documentation](/docs/charts).

## Custom Components

Minimal Docs allows you to create custom components to enhance your documentation and
provide additional functionality. You can define custom components in the `/src/components/mdx`
directory and register them in `/src/mdx-components.tsx`.

Custom components can be used in your MDX files to add interactive elements, embed external
content, or provide additional information. They allow you to extend the capabilities of
your documentation and create a more engaging user experience.

## Easy Extensibility

Minimal Docs is built with Next.js and TypeScript, making it easy to modify and extend the
documentation to suit your project's requirements. You can edit the existing components,
styles, and content, or add new features and integrations as needed.

The codebase is well-organized and documented, making it easy to navigate and understand.
You can quickly find the files you need and make changes with confidence, knowing that the
documentation will remain clean and functional.

For more information on how to create custom components in Minimal Docs, check out the
[Custom Components documentation](/docs/custom-components).

## Centralized Search Spotlight

Minimal Docs includes a centralized search spotlight that allows users to quickly locate
relevant information within the documentation. The search spotlight provides real-time
search results as you type, making it easy to find the content you need.

The search spotlight is powered by [@mantine/spotlight](https://mantine.dev/x/spotlight/),
a flexible and customizable search component. You can easily configure the search spotlight
to match your project's branding and styling, ensuring a seamless integration with your
documentation.
