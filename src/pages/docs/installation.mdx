## Documentation Configuration

The documentation is configured using a `/src/config.ts` file. This file contains the following configuration:


You can customize the documentation configuration by modifying the `DocConfig` object. You can
add more groups and pages to the documentation by adding new objects to the `Group` array. Each 
group object should have a `Name` property and a `Pages` array containing the pages for that group.

File: [config.ts](https://github.com/mohitxskull/Minimal/blob/main/src/config.ts)

### Extending the Config

You can extend the configuration by adding more properties to the `DocConfig` type
which is defined in `/src/lib/types.ts`. You can add more properties to the `Doc` object
to customize the documentation further.

## Customizing the Theme

The documentation theme is configured using a `/src/theme.ts` file. This file contains the following theme configuration:

This is the default theme configuration for the documentation, For more detailed
information on customizing the theme, refer to the [Mantine Documentation](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/).

File: [theme.tsx](https://github.com/mohitxskull/Minimal/blob/main/src/theme.tsx)

### Font

The default font used in the documentation is `Instrument Sans`.
You can change the font by modifying the `fontFamily` property in the theme configuration.

To use Google Fonts, you can import the font using the `next/font/google` package and set the `fontFamily` property to the imported font,
Refer to [Next/Font](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) for more information on importing and
using Google Fonts in Next.js.

For Custom Font also use the same method as Google Fonts.

<Code>
```ts
import localFont from 'next/font/local'
 
// Font files can be colocated inside of `pages`
const myFont = localFont({ src: './my-font.woff2' })
 
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <main className={myFont.className}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </main>
  )
}
```
</Code>

## Custom Components

You can create custom components for the documentation by adding them to the `/src/components/mdx` directory, And
then import them in the `/src/mdx-components.tsx` file.

Import them dynimically in the `/src/mdx-components.tsx` file else they will increase the initial bundel size of the application.

File: [mdx-components.tsx](https://github.com/mohitxskull/Minimal/blob/main/src/mdx-components.tsx)

## Static Assets

You can add static assets like images, videos, and other files to the `/public` directory. These assets can be accessed using the `/` path.

For example, if you have an image in the `/public/images` directory, you can access it using the `/images` path.

* `/public/favicon.png` is the default favicon for the documentation.
* `/public/og-banner.png` is the default Open Graph banner for the documentation. You can
  customize this banner or use dynamic Open Graph images by putting the API URL in the `og:image` meta tag.
