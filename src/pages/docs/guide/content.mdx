# Content

Adding a new content type is as simple as creating a new file in the `/src/pages/docs` directory. The file should be a 
markdown file with a `.mdx` extension.

You also need to register the new page/content in the `/src/config.ts` file. This is where the sidebar navigation is
configured.

## Base URL

The default base URL for the site is `/docs`. This can be changed in the `/src/config.ts` file.
