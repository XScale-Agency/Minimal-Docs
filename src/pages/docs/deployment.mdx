# Deployment

Minimal Docs is built using Next.js and can be deployed to Vercel, Netlify, or any other hosting platform that supports Node.js.

Also for the best performance, you can deploy it as a static site. ( *Only if you don't have any dynamic content* )

## Vercel

### Template

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/mohitxskull/Minimal)

### Manual

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository.

2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new) and import your fork.

3. Deploy your site.

### CI/CD

vercel `deploy --prebuilt` skips the build step on Vercel and uploads the previously generated `.vercel/output` folder from the GitHub Action. Let’s create our Action by creating a new file `.github/workflows/preview.yaml`

<Code>
```yaml
name: Vercel Preview Deployment
env:
  VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_USER_ID }}
  VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - dev
jobs:
  Deploy-Preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: common
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - name: Install Vercel CLI
        run: npm install --global vercel@latest
      - name: Pull Vercel Environment Information
        run: vercel pull --yes --environment=preview --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
      - name: Build Project Artifacts
        run: vercel build --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
      - name: Deploy Project Artifacts to Vercel
        run: vercel deploy --prebuilt --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```
</Code>

This Action will run when your code is pushed to a git branch. Let’s do the same for Production environments with a separate Action file `.github/workflows/production.yaml`

<Code>
```yaml
name: Vercel Production Deployment
env:
  VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_USER_ID }}
  VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  Deploy-Production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: common
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: "20"
      - name: Install Vercel CLI
        run: npm install --global vercel@latest
      - name: Pull Vercel Environment Information
        run: vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
      - name: Build Project Artifacts
        run: vercel build --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
      - name: Deploy Project Artifacts to Vercel
        run: vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```
</Code>

Finally, let’s add the required values as secrets in GitHub:

1. Go to your GitHub repository and navigate to:

`Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions` → `Manage environment secrets` → `New environment`.

2. Create a new environment `common` with the following secrets:

- `VERCEL_USER_ID`: Your Vercel ID. Visit [Vercel](https://vercel.com/account) to get your Vercel ID.
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Your Vercel Project ID. Visit your Vercel project settings to get your Project ID.
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel Token. Visit [Vercel](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) to create a new token.

With these secrets in place, your GitHub Actions will be able to deploy your site to Vercel.

## Static Site

Next.js allows you to export your site as static HTML, which can be hosted on any static site hosting platform.

1. Uncommnet the `output` property in `next.config.js`.

Visit [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) before exporting the site so you
know the limitations.

<Code>
```mjs
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  output: 'export',
  pageExtensions: ['mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
};
```
</Code>

2. Run the following command:

<Code>
```bash
yarn build
```
</Code>

3. The static files will be generated in the `out` directory.

4. You can host the files in the `out` directory on any static site hosting platform.

## Other

You can also deploy the site to other platforms like Netlify, AWS, etc.
