# Deployment

Minimal Docs is built using Next.js and can be deployed to Vercel, Netlify, or any other hosting platform that supports Node.js.

Also for the best performance, you can deploy it as a static site. ( *Only if you don't have any dynamic content* )

## Static Site

Next.js allows you to export your site as static HTML, which can be hosted on any static site hosting platform.

1. Uncommnet the `output` property in `next.config.js`.

Visit [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) before exporting the site so you
know the limitations.

<Code>
```mjs
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,

  output: 'export',

  pageExtensions: ['mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
};
```
</Code>

2. Run the following command:

<Code>
```bash
yarn build
```
</Code>

3. The static files will be generated in the `out` directory.

4. You can host the files in the `out` directory on any static site hosting platform.
